SSOwat was initially built by Kload, for YunoHost v2.

Design was created by Théodore 'Tozz' Faure and Thomas 'Courgette' Lebeau and implemented by Courgette himself.

Most of code was written by Kload and opi, with help of numerous contributors.

Translation is made by a bunch of lovely people over the world.

We would like to thank anyone who ever helped the YunoHost project, and especially the SSOwat project <3
